    "question": "Are there different types of black holes?",
    "context": "Black holes are celestial objects that have a gravitational pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. There are different types of black holes, including stellar black holes, supermassive black holes, and micro black holes.",

    "context": "Yes, gravity can form waves. This phenomenon is known as gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects. These waves were first detected in 2015 by the LIGO and Virgo observatories.",

    "question": "Does sound travel faster in space?",
    "context": "In a vacuum, sound travels at a speed of approximately 343 meters per second, which is the same speed as light. However, in space, the concept of sound as we know it does not apply because there is no medium for sound waves to travel through. Instead, electromagnetic waves, including light and radio waves, are the primary means of transmitting information in space.",

    "context": "Space probes use advanced navigation and avoidance systems to safely pass through the asteroid belt. These systems include radar, optical sensors, and onboard computers that can detect and maneuver around asteroids. Additionally, space probes are usually launched on trajectories that are carefully calculated to avoid known asteroids.",

    "context": "Astronomers use a combination of observational data, theoretical models, and mathematical calculations to understand the universe. They observe celestial objects with telescopes and other instruments, analyze the data, and use it to infer properties of distant objects. Additionally, astronomers often compare observations from different observatories to verify their findings and to confirm theories.",

    "question": "How can there be anything left in the universe? Don't black holes suck everything in?",
    "context": "Black holes are indeed powerful vacuum cleaners of the universe, but not all matter ends up in them. Stars and galaxies are constantly being formed and destroyed in the universe, and these new objects can contain matter that was not previously in a black hole. Additionally, black holes can lose mass through processes like Hawking radiation, which allows some matter to escape.",

    "context": "Black holes are not made of matter or antimatter; they are singularities at the center of massive objects like stars. The distinction between a black hole made out of antimatter and one made out of matter is not relevant because black holes do not contain matter or antimatter; they are regions of infinite density and curvature.",

    "context": "The sun appears white to the human eye because it emits light of all colors. However, when viewed through a prism or a spectroscope, the sun's light is broken down into its component colors, revealing that the sun is primarily composed of hydrogen, which emits light in the yellow part of the spectrum.",
